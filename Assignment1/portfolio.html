      <p>
        As a computer science graduate, dedicated teacher, and passionate programmer, I thrive at the intersection of technology and education. My journey began with a fascination for coding, which led me to pursue a degree in computer science. Throughout my academic journey, I've delved into various programming languages and technologies, honing my skills to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions.
        
        My love for teaching emerged naturally as I found joy in sharing my knowledge and empowering others to explore the world of programming. As a teacher, I strive to create engaging learning experiences that inspire curiosity and foster critical thinking among my students. Whether it's introducing the fundamentals of coding or diving deep into advanced topics, I am committed to nurturing the next generation of technologists.
        
        In addition to my role as an educator, I am an avid programmer, constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my expertise. I enjoy diving into projects that allow me to push the boundaries of what's possible, whether it's developing software applications, building websites, or contributing to open-source projects.
        
        With a blend of academic knowledge, teaching experience, and programming skills, I am driven to make a positive impact in both the classroom and the tech industry. Let's connect and embark on this journey together.
